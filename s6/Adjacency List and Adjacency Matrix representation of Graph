Adjacency List:::
An Adjacency list is an array consisting of the address of all the linked lists. The first node of the linked list represents the vertex and the remaining lists connected to this node represents the vertices to which this node is connected. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. The linked list can slightly be changed to even store the weight of the edge.


Adjacency Matrix:::
is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph. Let the 2D array be adj[][], a slot adj[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j. Adjacency matrix for undirected graph is always symmetric. Adjacency Matrix is also used to represent weighted graphs. If adj[i][j] = w, then there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j with weight w.

     This representation makes use of VxV matrix                                 In this representation, for every vertex we store its neighbours. In  so   space required in worst case is O(|V|2).   
       the worst case, if a graph is connected O(V) is required
       for a vertex and O(E)
      Thus, overall space complexity is O(|V|+|E|)
