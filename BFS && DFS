DFS 
Depth First Search, is an edge-based technique. It uses the Stack data structure and performs two stages,
first visited vertices are pushed into the stack, and second if there are no vertices then visited vertices are popped.

how"?
Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.

BFS, Breadth-First Search, is a vertex-based technique for finding the shortest path in the graph.
It uses a Queue data structure that follows first in first out. In BFS, one vertex is selected at a time
when it is visited and marked then its adjacent are visited and stored in the queue. It is slower than DFS. 

Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices at the back of a queue.
Take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the back of the queue.
Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty.
